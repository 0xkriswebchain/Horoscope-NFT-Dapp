## Horoscope NFT Project

## Overview

The Horoscope NFT project is a full-stack application that allows users to mint and collect unique NFTs based on their zodiac signs. The project consists of a smart contract, a backend API, and a frontend user interface.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract is written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to mint NFTs with their corresponding zodiac signs and stores the NFT metadata on-chain.

## Backend API

The backend API is built using Node.js and Hardhat. It provides a RESTful API for users to interact with the smart contract, including minting NFTs, retrieving NFT metadata, and transferring NFT ownership.

## Frontend UI

The frontend UI is built using React.js and provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the application. It allows users to connect their Ethereum wallets, mint NFTs, view their NFT collections, and transfer NFTs to other users.
